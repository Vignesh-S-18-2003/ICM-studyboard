                          Australia can be considered relatively costly for
                          Indian students due to high tuition fees and living
                          expenses. Tuition fees range from AUD 20,000 to AUD
                          45,000 per year, depending on the course and
                          institution. Living expenses, including accommodation,
                          food, transportation, and health insurance, can add
                          another AUD 15,000 to AUD 25,000 annually. However,
                          many students find that the quality of education and
                          potential job opportunities justify the investment.
                          Itâ€™s essential to budget wisely and explore
                          scholarships to help manage costs.
